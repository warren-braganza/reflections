When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository whenever I need to make my project accesible from an online portal to allow me to work with any device from any location with an interntet connection. I could also use a public remote repository to share and collaborate on projects with other users.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes automatically could have side effects such as overwriting of code, especially when multiple persons are working in the repository. Hence a manual approach 
offers greater security and reliability by allowing the user to decide whether or not a pull operation is safe and reliable. Manual Mode gives the user full control.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is a copy of a repository from a remote to a local machine or from a local machine to another local machine.
A branch is a variant timeline of commits created from an existing repository to add experimental or variant changes in the project. The changes can be merged back
to the master branch which is the primary branch in git.
A Fork is like a clone of a project from one github user to another. It maintains the history of forks such as number of forks, origin project, etc.
